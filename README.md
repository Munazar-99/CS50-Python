# Havard's CS50 -PYTHON

 This repository serves as a platform to track my progress and store the code I write throughout the course. Below, you will find an overview of the contents and structure of my repository.

## Course Overview

 The course covers a range of topics, from fundamental concepts to more advanced techniques, preparing me to tackle real-world programming challenges.

## Repository Contents

1. **Exercises**: This directory contains the exercises I complete as part of the course. These exercises are inspired by real-world programming problems and will help me apply the concepts I learn.
2. **Code Examples**: Here, I will store code examples provided during the course. These examples serve as references for understanding various programming concepts.
3. **Projects**: As I progress through the course, I will work on personal projects to reinforce my learning. Each project will have its own directory within this folder.
4. **Resources**: This directory contains additional resources, such as cheat sheets, documentation, or helpful articles, that I find useful during my learning journey.
5. **README.md**: The primary documentation for my repository, this file provides an overview of the repository's structure and outlines the contents of each folder.
